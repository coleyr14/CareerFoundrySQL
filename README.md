Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

In this scenario, I was hired as a data analyst by the business intelligence department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The business intelligence department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.  Then will use SQL to analyze the data.
